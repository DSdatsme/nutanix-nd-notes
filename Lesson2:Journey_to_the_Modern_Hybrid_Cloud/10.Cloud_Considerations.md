## Fiscal Consumption Models

- renting
  - Rent for backups, burst, and temporary workloads
  - The public cloudâ€™s optimal use-case is utility computing for workloads which can be turned on-and-off at will.
- buying
  - Buy for fixed, long-running and ongoing workloads.
  - Business can purchase on-prem private cloud and depreciate that investment as a capital expenditure, or CapEx, but also purchase off-prem private cloud resources for backup, burst load, and temporary workload needs as OpEx to augment their baseline workload capacity.

<!-- TODO: OpEx vs CapEx meaning -->
