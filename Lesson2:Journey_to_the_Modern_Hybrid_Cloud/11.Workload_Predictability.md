## When to use which cloud

### Public cloud

The public cloud is best for elastic workloads. The public cloud allows you to spin up or spin down resources to meet the workloadâ€™s demands quickly, easily, and efficiently when a workload is unpredictable.

### Private Cloud

The private cloud is great for predictable workloads. It is a secure and efficient way to run core workloads, with the agility and sit-back simplicity that IT teams want, and with the control that an organization needs for on-prem workloads.

### Hybrid Cloud

Distribute workloads across public and private cloud, still allows you to control and manage them centrally. The overall management of your deployment is simplified this way. This provides the required flexibility to make the best financial choice for your workloads, and deploy them where they run best.
