## Low Cloud Readiness

A low cloud readiness score means that technology and workforce skills are more traditional. This means the current environment is used exclusively to run legacy, shrink-wrapped applications.

# High Cloud Readiness

High cloud readiness means that the technologies and workforce skills that support IT are aligned with what is required to successfully use the full capabilities of the public, private and hybrid cloud.
