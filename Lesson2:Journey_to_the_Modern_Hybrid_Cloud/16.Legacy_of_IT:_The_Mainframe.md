# Legacy of IT: The Mainframe

[Mainframe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KpsZr2iuaE)

## Advantages of Mainframe

- The enormous resources and computing power that is provides via its monolithic, converged architecture. It is, for example, 18 times faster than an x86 platform.
- It also provides decades of uptime and provides high levels of security.
- It also supports virtualization, which is an increasingly critical element of computing infrastructure today.

## Disadvantages of Mainframe

- Having access to the extensive amount of resources a mainframe provides requires a massive capital investment.
- Mainframes only get more expensive when they need to scale, because their monolithic architectures require massive blocks to expand.
- Thereâ€™s also the concern of vendor lock-in, due to the use of proprietary hardware and software.
- Finally, operating, managing, and maintaining such a complex piece of computing technology requires highly specialized skills.
