# Application Design: The Monolith

Monolith: one, single source of every component in the stack.

Challenges with applications like this are:

## Application

- Single code base for all application functionality.
- Local execution with local data.
- Scale up resources to address performance by increasing CPU memory usage.

## Infrastructure

- It is a single application written in a single language.
- It is provided by a single vendor, who potentially also controls the application development tools, database, and operating system layers that are running on their hardware.
