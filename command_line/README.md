## Terminal Tips

To clear the contents of the file without deleting it try:

```sh
truncate -s 0 file.txt
```

To list the number of directories or files in a folder:

```sh
tree folder/ | tail -1
```

To force kill processes from a certain program:

```sh
kill -9 $(pgrep <program-name>)
```

## Terminal Tour

This week we will be covering search methods in the command line.

**Description :**
We will begin with grep, a powerful pattern-matching tool.
Given one or more patterns, *`grep`* searches input files for matches to the patterns, the matching lines are copied to std output.
Manual:

```sh
grep [option...] [patterns] [file...]
```

option: here it includes a huge number of options that can be specified for pattern matching like ignoring case or attaching the pattern file.
pattern: A pattern can be a simple string or a  `regular expression` , we will cover regular expression in the coming days.
file: The file in which we will search for pattern.

Example:

```sh
grep myname file.txt
```

here the file.txt contains :

```sh
myname is xyz.
I am studying at so and so.
```

The output:

```sh
myname is xyz.
```

## Terminal Test

## Terminal Tips

You end up in a long directory path and then you realize that you have to go back to the previous directory

```sh
cd -
```

Imagine a situation where you used a long command and you have to use it again

```sh
ctrl+r search term
```

To read the output well without overcrowding and as table, example when you read a mount file

```sh
mount | column â€“t
```

## Terminal Tour

This week we will be covering search methods in the command line.
Today, we will take a look at pattern matching with regular expressions in brief.
we saw that we can use grep as : `grep pattern file.txt`

Today we cover a specific pattern description called wildcards, So let's start.

- We use `.` to match any character before or after a set of ascii characters
ex: `..cept` can match the strings accept, except, etc.
- Similarly if we need to match more than one character we use `*`
ex: `cert*` can match the strings certificate, certification, etc.
- If we need to find strings with only certain characters before or after a set of ascii characters we cover them in `[]`
ex: `t[wo]o` matches both the strings too and two, as either w or o can be selected in the second character's place.
- If we need to specify rather a range of characters we can do so with specifying the first and last witht the hyphen `-` in the brackets
ex: `[A-Z]*` matches all the strings with capital letters like Arizona, The, etc.

## Terminal Test

A quick quiz on having grasped the above regular expressions.
Assume the search string contains this :

```text

2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright

```

What do these pattern match (write only the unique string):

1. `[N-R]*`
2. `co[pd]*`
3. `no..*`
